# Airbnb Clone Project - ProDev Back End
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Team Roles

**Business Analyst (BA)** - Analyzes stakeholder feedback to help a client formulate what their wants look like and align a customer’s vision with what a development team is producing.

**Product Owner (PO)** - Holds more responsibility for a product’s success than any other development team member for the product vision and evolution and makes sure the final product meets customer requirements

**Project Manager (PM)** - Oversees project scope, schedule, budget, and risk management; in Agile, collaborates closely with the PO to optimize delivery.

**UI/UX Designer** - Focuses on user journeys, usability testing, wireframes, and the product’s visual and interactive design.

**Software Architect** - Defines the system architecture and tech stack. Ensures scalability, performance, and maintainability.

**Software Developer** - Build and maintain the application’s functionality. Specializations include front-end, back-end, and mobile development.

**Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer** - Tests functionality, performance, and reliability. Uses manual and automated methods to ensure quality.

**Test Automation Engineer** - Develop test automation scripts—small programs that provide reliable and continuous feedback on application quality without any human involvement.

**DevOps Engineer** - Streamlines deployment and CI/CD pipelines, enabling faster release cycles and robust infrastructure.

- **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design

The key entities required for the project's database structure.

1. **Users**: Represents customers, hosts, and admins.

2. **Properties**: Listings available for rent (e.g., apartments, houses).

3. **Bookings**: Reservation records linking users to properties.

4. **Reviews**: Feedback from users about properties or hosts.

5. **Payments**: Tracks financial transactions related to bookings.
